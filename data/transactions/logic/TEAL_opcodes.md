## bnz target

- Opcode: 0x40 {int16 branch offset, big endian}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...
- branch to TARGET if value A is not zero

The `bnz` instruction opcode 0x40 is followed by two immediate data bytes which are a high byte first and low byte second which together form a 16 bit offset which the instruction may branch to. For a bnz instruction at `pc`, if the last element of the stack is not zero then branch to instruction at `pc + 3 + N`, else proceed to next instruction at `pc + 3`. Branch targets must be aligned instructions. (e.g. Branching to the second byte of a 2 byte op will be rejected.) Starting at v4, the offset is treated as a signed 16 bit integer allowing for backward branches and looping. In prior version (v1 to v3), branch offsets are limited to forward branches only, 0-0x7fff.

At v2 it became allowed to branch to the end of the program exactly after the last instruction: bnz to byte N (with 0-indexing) was illegal for a TEAL program with N bytes before v2, and is legal after it. This change eliminates the need for a last instruction of no-op as a branch target at the end. (Branching beyond the end--in other words, to a byte larger than N--is still illegal and will cause the program to fail.)

## bz target

- Opcode: 0x41 {int16 branch offset, big endian}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...

- Stack: ..., A, B: uint64, C: uint64 &rarr; ..., any
- Copy of (byte-array or integer) A, with the Bth bit set to (0 or 1) C
- Availability: v3

When A is a uint64, index 0 is the least significant bit. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the integer 0 yields 8, or 2^3. When A is a byte array, index 0 is the leftmost bit of the leftmost byte. Setting bits 0 through 11 to 1 in a 4-byte-array of 0s yields the byte array 0xfff00000. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the 1-byte-array 0x00 yields the byte array 0x10.

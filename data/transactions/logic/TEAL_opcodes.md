## bnz target

- Opcode: 0x40 {int16 branch offset, big-endian}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...
- branch to TARGET if value A is not zero

The `bnz` instruction opcode 0x40 is followed by two immediate data bytes which are a high byte first and low byte second which together form a 16 bit offset which the instruction may branch to. For a bnz instruction at `pc`, if the last element of the stack is not zero then branch to instruction at `pc + 3 + N`, else proceed to next instruction at `pc + 3`. Branch targets must be aligned instructions. (e.g. Branching to the second byte of a 2 byte op will be rejected.) Starting at v4, the offset is treated as a signed 16 bit integer allowing for backward branches and looping. In prior version (v1 to v3), branch offsets are limited to forward branches only, 0-0x7fff.

At v2 it became allowed to branch to the end of the program exactly after the last instruction: bnz to byte N (with 0-indexing) was illegal for a TEAL program with N bytes before v2, and is legal after it. This change eliminates the need for a last instruction of no-op as a branch target at the end. (Branching beyond the end--in other words, to a byte larger than N--is still illegal and will cause the program to fail.)

## bz target

- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...

- Copy of (byte-array or integer) A, with the Bth bit set to (0 or 1) C. If B is greater than or equal to the bit length of the value (8*byte length), the program fails
- Availability: v3

When A is a uint64, index 0 is the least significant bit. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the integer 0 yields 8, or 2^3. When A is a byte array, index 0 is the leftmost bit of the leftmost byte. Setting bits 0 through 11 to 1 in a 4-byte-array of 0s yields the byte array 0xfff00000. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the 1-byte-array 0x00 yields the byte array 0x10.

- Availability: v7

`base64` Encodings:

| Index | Name | Notes |
| - | ------ | --------- |
| 0 | URLEncoding |  |
| 1 | StdEncoding |  |


*Warning*: Usage should be restricted to very rare use cases. In almost all cases, smart contracts should directly handle non-encoded byte-strings.	This opcode should only be used in cases where base64 is the only available option, e.g. interoperability with a third-party that only signs base64 strings.

 Decodes A using the base64 encoding E. Specify the encoding with an immediate arg either as URL and Filename Safe (`URLEncoding`) or Standard (`StdEncoding`). See [RFC 4648 sections 4 and 5](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html#section-4). It is assumed that the encoding ends with the exact number of `=` padding characters as required by the RFC. When padding occurs, any unused pad bits in the encoding must be set to zero or the decoding will fail. The special cases of `\n` and `\r` are allowed but completely ignored. An error will result when attempting to decode a string with a character that is not in the encoding alphabet or not one of `=`, `\r`, or `\n`.

## json_ref r

- Stack: ..., A: []byte, B: []byte &rarr; ..., any

| - | ------ | -- | --------- |
| 0 | JSONString | []byte |  |
| 1 | JSONUint64 | uint64 |  |
| 2 | JSONObject | []byte |  |


*Warning*: Usage should be restricted to very rare use cases, as JSON decoding is expensive and quite limited. In addition, JSON objects are large and not optimized for size.

Almost all smart contracts should use simpler and smaller methods (such as the [ABI](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0004). This opcode should only be used in cases where JSON is only available option, e.g. when a third-party only signs JSON.

## min_balance

- Opcode: 0x78

- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ..., []byte
- zero filled byte-array of length A
- Availability: v4

## log

- Opcode: 0xb0
- Stack: ..., A: []byte &rarr; ...
- write A to log state of the current application
- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

`log` fails if called more than MaxLogCalls times in a program, or if the sum of logged bytes exceeds 1024 bytes.

## itxn_begin

- Opcode: 0xb1
- Stack: ... &rarr; ...
- begin preparation of a new inner transaction in a new transaction group
- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

`itxn_begin` initializes Sender to the application address; Fee to the minimum allowable, taking into account MinTxnFee and credit from overpaying in earlier transactions; FirstValid/LastValid to the values in the invoking transaction, and all other fields to zero or empty values.

## itxn_field f

- Opcode: 0xb2 {uint8 transaction field index}
- Stack: ..., A &rarr; ...
- set field F of the current inner transaction to A
- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

`itxn_field` fails if A is of the wrong type for F, including a byte array of the wrong size for use as an address when F is an address field. `itxn_field` also fails if A is an account, asset, or app that is not _available_, or an attempt is made extend an array field beyond the limit imposed by consensus parameters. (Addresses set into asset params of acfg transactions need not be _available_.)

## itxn_submit

- Opcode: 0xb3
- Stack: ... &rarr; ...
- execute the current inner transaction group. Fail if executing this group would exceed the inner transaction limit, or if any transaction in the group fails.
- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

`itxn_submit` resets the current transaction so that it can not be resubmitted. A new `itxn_begin` is required to prepare another inner transaction.

## itxn f

- Opcode: 0xb4 {uint8 transaction field index}
- Stack: ... &rarr; ..., any
- field F of the last inner transaction
- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

## itxna f i

- Availability: v5
- Mode: Application

## itxn_next

- Opcode: 0xb6
- Stack: ... &rarr; ...
- begin preparation of a new inner transaction in the same transaction group
- Availability: v6
- Mode: Application

`itxn_next` initializes the transaction exactly as `itxn_begin` does

## gitxn t f

- Opcode: 0xb7 {uint8 transaction group index} {uint8 transaction field index}
- Stack: ... &rarr; ..., any
- field F of the Tth transaction in the last inner group submitted
- Availability: v6
- Mode: Application

## gitxna t f i

- Opcode: 0xb8 {uint8 transaction group index} {uint8 transaction field index} {uint8 transaction field array index}

- Availability: v6
- Mode: Application

## box_create

- Opcode: 0xb9
- Stack: ..., A: []byte, B: uint64 &rarr; ..., uint64
- create a box named A, of length B. Fail if A is empty or B exceeds 32,768. Returns 0 if A already existed, else 1
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

Newly created boxes are filled with 0 bytes. `box_create` will fail if the referenced box already exists with a different size. Otherwise, existing boxes are unchanged by `box_create`.

## box_extract

- Opcode: 0xba
- Stack: ..., A: []byte, B: uint64, C: uint64 &rarr; ..., []byte
- read C bytes from box A, starting at offset B. Fail if A does not exist, or the byte range is outside A's size.
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

## box_replace

- Opcode: 0xbb
- Stack: ..., A: []byte, B: uint64, C: []byte &rarr; ...
- write byte-array C into box A, starting at offset B. Fail if A does not exist, or the byte range is outside A's size.
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

## box_del

- Opcode: 0xbc
- Stack: ..., A: []byte &rarr; ..., uint64
- delete box named A if it exists. Return 1 if A existed, 0 otherwise
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

## box_len

- Opcode: 0xbd
- Stack: ..., A: []byte &rarr; ..., X: uint64, Y: uint64
- X is the length of box A if A exists, else 0. Y is 1 if A exists, else 0.
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

## box_get

- Opcode: 0xbe
- Stack: ..., A: []byte &rarr; ..., X: []byte, Y: uint64
- X is the contents of box A if A exists, else ''. Y is 1 if A exists, else 0.
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

For boxes that exceed 4,096 bytes, consider `box_create`, `box_extract`, and `box_replace`

## box_put

- Opcode: 0xbf
- Stack: ..., A: []byte, B: []byte &rarr; ...
- replaces the contents of box A with byte-array B. Fails if A exists and len(B) != len(box A). Creates A if it does not exist
- Availability: v8
- Mode: Application

For boxes that exceed 4,096 bytes, consider `box_create`, `box_extract`, and `box_replace`

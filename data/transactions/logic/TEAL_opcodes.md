## gtxn t f

- Opcode: 0x33 {uint8 transaction group index} {uint8 transaction field index}
- Pops: _None_
- Pushes: any
- push field F of the Tth transaction in the current group

for notes on transaction fields available, see `txn`. If this transaction is _i_ in the group, `gtxn i field` is equivalent to `txn field`.

## load i

- Opcode: 0x34 {uint8 position in scratch space to load from}
- Pops: _None_
- Pushes: any
- copy a value from scratch space to the stack

## store i

- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: any
- push field F of the Ath transaction in the current group
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

for notes on transaction fields available, see `txn`. If top of stack is _i_, `gtxns field` is equivalent to `gtxn _i_ field`. gtxns exists so that _i_ can be calculated, often based on the index of the current transaction.

## gtxnsa f i

- Opcode: 0x39 {uint8 transaction field index} {uint8 transaction field array index}
- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: any
- push Ith value of the array field F from the Ath transaction in the current group
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

## bnz target

- Opcode: 0x40 {int16 branch offset, big endian. (negative offsets are illegal before v4)}
- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: _None_
- branch to TARGET if value X is not zero

The `bnz` instruction opcode 0x40 is followed by two immediate data bytes which are a high byte first and low byte second which together form a 16 bit offset which the instruction may branch to. For a bnz instruction at `pc`, if the last element of the stack is not zero then branch to instruction at `pc + 3 + N`, else proceed to next instruction at `pc + 3`. Branch targets must be well aligned instructions. (e.g. Branching to the second byte of a 2 byte op will be rejected.) Branch offsets are limited to forward branches only, 0-0x7fff until v4. v4 treats offset as a signed 16 bit integer allowing for backward branches and looping.

At LogicSigVersion 2 it became allowed to branch to the end of the program exactly after the last instruction: bnz to byte N (with 0-indexing) was illegal for a TEAL program with N bytes before LogicSigVersion 2, and is legal after it. This change eliminates the need for a last instruction of no-op as a branch target at the end. (Branching beyond the end--in other words, to a byte larger than N--is still illegal and will cause the program to fail.)

## bz target

- Opcode: 0x41 {int16 branch offset, big endian. (negative offsets are illegal before v4)}
- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: _None_
- branch to TARGET if value X is zero
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

See `bnz` for details on how branches work. `bz` inverts the behavior of `bnz`.

## b target

- Opcode: 0x42 {int16 branch offset, big endian. (negative offsets are illegal before v4)}
- Pops: _None_
- Pushes: _None_
- branch unconditionally to TARGET
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

See `bnz` for details on how branches work. `b` always jumps to the offset.

## return

- Pushes: _None_
- use last value on stack as success value; end
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

## assert

## dup2

- Opcode: 0x4a
- Pops: *... stack*, {any A}, {any B}
- Pushes: *... stack*, any, any, any, any
- duplicate two last values on stack: A, B -> A, B, A, B
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

## dig n

- Opcode: 0x4b {uint8 depth}
- Pops: *... stack*, any
- Pushes: *... stack*, any, any

- LogicSigVersion >= 3

## swap

- Opcode: 0x4c
- Pops: *... stack*, {any A}, {any B}
- Pushes: *... stack*, any, any
- swaps two last values on stack: A, B -> B, A
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

- selects one of two values based on top-of-stack: A, B, C -> (if C != 0 then B else A)
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

## concat

- Opcode: 0x50
- Pops: *... stack*, {[]byte A}, {[]byte B}
- Pushes: []byte

`concat` panics if the result would be greater than 4096 bytes.

## substring s e

- Opcode: 0x51 {uint8 start position} {uint8 end position}
- Pops: *... stack*, []byte
- Pushes: []byte
- pop a byte-array A. For immediate values in 0..255 S and E: extract a range of bytes from A starting at S up to but not including E, push the substring result. If E < S, or either is larger than the array length, the program fails
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

## substring3

- Opcode: 0x52
- Pops: *... stack*, {[]byte A}, {uint64 B}, {uint64 C}
- Pushes: []byte
- pop a byte-array A and two integers B and C. Extract a range of bytes from A starting at B up to but not including C, push the substring result. If C < B, or either is larger than the array length, the program fails
- LogicSigVersion >= 2

## getbit

- Opcode: 0x53
- Pops: *... stack*, {any A}, {uint64 B}
- Pushes: uint64
- pop a target A (integer or byte-array), and index B. Push the Bth bit of A.
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

see explanation of bit ordering in setbit

## setbit

- Opcode: 0x54
- Pops: *... stack*, {any A}, {uint64 B}, {uint64 C}
- Pushes: uint64
- pop a target A, index B, and bit C. Set the Bth bit of A to C, and push the result
- LogicSigVersion >= 3

bit indexing begins with low-order bits in integers. Setting bit 4 to 1 on the integer 0 yields 16 (`int 0x0010`, or 2^4). Indexing begins in the first bytes of a byte-string (as seen in getbyte and substring). Setting bits 0 through 11 to 1 in a 4 byte-array of 0s yields `byte 0xfff00000`

## getbyte

- Opcode: 0x55
- Pops: *... stack*, {[]byte A}, {uint64 B}
- Pushes: uint64
- pop a byte-array A and integer B. Extract the Bth byte of A and push it as an integer

- Mode: Application

params: account index, state key, value.

## app_global_put

- Opcode: 0x67
- Pops: *... stack*, {[]byte A}, {any B}
- Pushes: _None_
- write key A and value B to global state of the current application
- LogicSigVersion >= 2
- Mode: Application

## app_local_del

- Opcode: 0x68
- Pops: *... stack*, {uint64 A}, {[]byte B}
- Pushes: _None_
- delete from account specified by Txn.Accounts[A] local state key B of the current application
- LogicSigVersion >= 2
- Mode: Application

params: account index, state key.

Deleting a key which is already absent has no effect on the application local state. (In particular, it does _not_ cause the program to fail.)

## app_global_del

- Opcode: 0x69
- Pops: *... stack*, []byte
- Pushes: _None_
- delete key A from a global state of the current application
- LogicSigVersion >= 2
- Mode: Application

params: state key.

Deleting a key which is already absent has no effect on the application global state. (In particular, it does _not_ cause the program to fail.)

## asset_holding_get i

- Opcode: 0x70 {uint8 asset holding field index}
- Pops: *... stack*, {uint64 A}, {uint64 B}
- Pushes: *... stack*, any, uint64
- read from account specified by Txn.Accounts[A] and asset B holding field X (imm arg) => {0 or 1 (top), value}
- LogicSigVersion >= 2
- Mode: Application

`asset_holding_get` Fields:

| Index | Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | AssetBalance | uint64 | Amount of the asset unit held by this account |
| 1 | AssetFrozen | uint64 | Is the asset frozen or not |


params: account index, asset id. Return: did_exist flag (1 if exist and 0 otherwise), value.

## asset_params_get i

- Opcode: 0x71 {uint8 asset params field index}
- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: *... stack*, any, uint64
- read from asset Txn.ForeignAssets[A] params field X (imm arg) => {0 or 1 (top), value}
- LogicSigVersion >= 2
- Mode: Application

`asset_params_get` Fields:

| Index | Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | AssetTotal | uint64 | Total number of units of this asset |
| 1 | AssetDecimals | uint64 | See AssetParams.Decimals |
| 2 | AssetDefaultFrozen | uint64 | Frozen by default or not |
| 3 | AssetUnitName | []byte | Asset unit name |
| 4 | AssetName | []byte | Asset name |
| 5 | AssetURL | []byte | URL with additional info about the asset |
| 6 | AssetMetadataHash | []byte | Arbitrary commitment |
| 7 | AssetManager | []byte | Manager commitment |
| 8 | AssetReserve | []byte | Reserve address |
| 9 | AssetFreeze | []byte | Freeze address |
| 10 | AssetClawback | []byte | Clawback address |


params: txn.ForeignAssets offset. Return: did_exist flag (1 if exist and 0 otherwise), value.

## min_balance

- Opcode: 0x78
- Pops: *... stack*, uint64
- Pushes: uint64
- get minimum required balance for the requested account specified by Txn.Accounts[A] in microalgos. A is specified as an account index in the Accounts field of the ApplicationCall transaction, zero index means the sender. Required balance is affected by [ASA](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asa/#assets-overview) and [App](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/stateful/#minimum-balance-requirement-for-a-smart-contract) usage. When creating or opting into an app, the minimum balance grows before the app code runs, therefore the increase is visible there. When deleting or closing out, the minimum balance decreases after the app executes.

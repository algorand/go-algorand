## bnz

- Syntax: `bnz TARGET` where TARGET: branch offset
- Bytecode: 0x40 {int16 (big-endian)}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...
- branch to TARGET if value A is not zero

The `bnz` instruction opcode 0x40 is followed by two immediate data bytes which are a high byte first and low byte second which together form a 16 bit offset which the instruction may branch to. For a bnz instruction at `pc`, if the last element of the stack is not zero then branch to instruction at `pc + 3 + N`, else proceed to next instruction at `pc + 3`. Branch targets must be aligned instructions. (e.g. Branching to the second byte of a 2 byte op will be rejected.) Starting at v4, the offset is treated as a signed 16 bit integer allowing for backward branches and looping. In prior version (v1 to v3), branch offsets are limited to forward branches only, 0-0x7fff.

At v2 it became allowed to branch to the end of the program exactly after the last instruction: bnz to byte N (with 0-indexing) was illegal for a TEAL program with N bytes before v2, and is legal after it. This change eliminates the need for a last instruction of no-op as a branch target at the end. (Branching beyond the end--in other words, to a byte larger than N--is still illegal and will cause the program to fail.)

## bz

- Syntax: `bz TARGET` where TARGET: branch offset
- Bytecode: 0x41 {int16 (big-endian)}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...
- branch to TARGET if value A is zero

See `bnz` for details on how branches work. `bz` inverts the behavior of `bnz`.

## b

- Syntax: `b TARGET` where TARGET: branch offset
- Bytecode: 0x42 {int16 (big-endian)}
- Stack: ... &rarr; ...
- branch unconditionally to TARGET

see explanation of bit ordering in setbit

## setbit

- Bytecode: 0x54
- Stack: ..., A, B: uint64, C: uint64 &rarr; ..., any
- Copy of (byte-array or integer) A, with the Bth bit set to (0 or 1) C. If B is greater than or equal to the bit length of the value (8*byte length), the program fails
- Availability: v3

When A is a uint64, index 0 is the least significant bit. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the integer 0 yields 8, or 2^3. When A is a byte array, index 0 is the leftmost bit of the leftmost byte. Setting bits 0 through 11 to 1 in a 4-byte-array of 0s yields the byte array 0xfff00000. Setting bit 3 to 1 on the 1-byte-array 0x00 yields the byte array 0x10.

## min_balance

- Bytecode: 0x78
- Stack: ..., A &rarr; ..., uint64
- minimum required balance for account A, in microalgos. Required balance is affected by ASA, App, and Box usage. When creating or opting into an app, the minimum balance grows before the app code runs, therefore the increase is visible there. When deleting or closing out, the minimum balance decreases after the app executes. Changes caused by inner transactions or box usage are observable immediately following the opcode effecting the change.

- Stack: ... &rarr; ..., any
- field F of the Tth transaction in the current group

## load

- Syntax: `load I` where I: position in scratch space to load from
- Bytecode: 0x34 {uint8}
- Stack: ... &rarr; ..., any
- Ith scratch space value. All scratch spaces are 0 at program start.

## store

- Syntax: `store I` where I: position in scratch space to store to
- Bytecode: 0x35 {uint8}
- Stack: ..., A &rarr; ...
- store A to the Ith scratch space

## bnz

- Syntax: `bnz TARGET` where TARGET: branch offset
- Bytecode: 0x40 {int16 (big-endian)}
- Stack: ..., A: uint64 &rarr; ...
- branch to TARGET if value A is not zero

The `bnz` instruction opcode 0x40 is followed by two immediate data bytes which are a high byte first and low byte second which together form a 16 bit offset which the instruction may branch to. For a bnz instruction at `pc`, if the last element of the stack is not zero then branch to instruction at `pc + 3 + N`, else proceed to next instruction at `pc + 3`. Branch targets must be aligned instructions. (e.g. Branching to the second byte of a 2 byte op will be rejected.) Starting at v4, the offset is treated as a signed 16 bit integer allowing for backward branches and looping. In prior version (v1 to v3), branch offsets are limited to forward branches only, 0-0x7fff.

At v2 it became allowed to branch to the end of the program exactly after the last instruction: bnz to byte N (with 0-indexing) was illegal for a TEAL program with N bytes before v2, and is legal after it. This change eliminates the need for a last instruction of no-op as a branch target at the end. (Branching beyond the end--in other words, to a byte larger than N--is still illegal and will cause the program to fail.)

		The seed is to mitigate against the (remote) possibility that an attacker can put itself in better position to
		find a collision in the future -- perhaps with quantum -- e.g., by doing some precomputation,
		knowing or even controlling the data to be hashed, etc. Starting the hash data with a value that is
		uncontrollable and unpredictable (to today’s attackers) makes the attacker’s task more like breaking 2nd
		preimage resistance (2PR/TCR), versus the easier goal of merely breaking collision resistance.
		In addition, we make sure that the Seed (The unpredictable value) would be the first field that gets
		hashed (give it the lowest codec value in the LightBlockHeader struct) to mitigate a collision attack
		on the merkle damgard construction.

		The BlockHash serves a similar role, in that it also depends on the seed and introduces some
		uncontrollable input.  It is slightly weaker, in the sense that an adversary can influence
		the BlockHash to some degree (e.g., by including specific transactions in the payset), but
		it comes with the added benefit of allowing to authenticate the entire blockchain based on
		the BlockHash value.

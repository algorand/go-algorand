# Vulnerability Disclosures

Algorand takes the security of the platform and of its users very seriously. We recognize the important role of external security researchers and developers in helping keep our community safe. As with most security reward programs, we ask that you use common sense when looking for security bugs. Vulnerabilities must be disclosed to us privately with reasonable time to respond, and avoid compromise of other users and accounts, or loss of funds that are not your own. We do not reward denial of service, spam, or social engineering vulnerabilities.

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability you may disclose it here:

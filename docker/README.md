# Algod Container

[![DockerHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/DockerHub-blue)](https://hub.docker.com/r/algorand/algod)

General purpose algod container image.

## Image Configuration

There are a number of special files and environment variables used to control how a container is started.

### Default Configuration

By default the following config.json overrides are applied:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| EndpointAddress | 0.0.0.0:8080 |

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be supplied. Except when noted, it is possible to reconfigure deployments even after the data directory has been initialized.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| NETWORK        | Leave blank for a private network, otherwise specify one of mainnet, betanet, testnet, or devnet. Only used during a data directory initialization. |
| FAST_CATCHUP   | If set to 1 on a public network, attempt to start fast-catchup during initial config.                                                               |
| TELEMETRY_NAME | If set on a public network, telemetry is reported with this name.                                                                                   |
| DEV_MODE       | If set to 1 on a private network, enable dev mode. Only used during data directory initialization.                                                  |
| NUM_ROUNDS     | If set on a private network, override default of 30000 participation keys.                                                                          |
| TOKEN          | If set, overrides the REST API token.                                                                                                               |
| ADMIN_TOKEN    | If set, overrides the REST API admin token.                                                                                                         |
| KMD_TOKEN      | If set along with `START_KMD`, override the KMD REST API token.                                                                                     |
| START_KMD      | When set to 1, start kmd service with no timeout. THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.                                                            |
| PEER_ADDRESS   | If set, override phonebook with peer ip:port (or semicolon separated list: ip:port;ip:port;ip:port...)                                              |

### Special Files

Configuration can be modified by specifying certain files. These can be changed each time you start the container if the data directory is a mounted volume.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| /etc/algorand/config.json | Override default configurations by providing your own file. |
| /etc/algorand/algod.token | Override default randomized REST API token. |
| /etc/algorand/algod.admin.token | Override default randomized REST API admin token. |
| /etc/algorand/logging.config | Use a custom [logging.config](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/telemetry-config/#configuration) file for configuring telemetry. |
 | /etc/algorand/template.json | Override default private network topology. One of the nodes in the template must be named "data".| 

## Example Configuration

The following command launches a container configured with one of the public networks:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -p 4190:8080 \
    -p 4191:7833 \
    -e NETWORK=mainnet \
    -e FAST_CATCHUP=1 \
    -e TELEMETRY_NAME=name \
    -e TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa \
    -e START_KMD=1 \
    -v ${PWD}/data:/algod/data/ \
    --name mainnet-container \
    algorand/algod:latest
```

Explanation of parts:

* `-p 4190:8080` maps the internal algod REST API to local port 4190.
* `-p 4191:7833` maps the internal kmd REST API to local port 4191.
* `-e NETWORK=mainnet` can be set to any of the supported public networks.
* `-e TELEMETRY_NAME=name` enables telemetry reporting to Algorand for network health analysis. The value of this variable takes precedence over the `name` attribute set in `/etc/algorand/logging.config`.
* `-e FAST_CATCHUP=1` causes fast catchup to start shortly after launching the network.
* `-e START_KMD=1` signals to entrypoint to start the kmd REST API (THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION).
* `-e TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` sets the REST API token to use.
* `-v ${PWD}/data:/algod/data/` mounts a local volume to the data directory, which can be used to restart and upgrade the deployment.

## Mounting the Data Directory

The data directory located at `/algod/data`. Mounting a volume at that location will allow you to shutdown and resume the node.

### Volume Permissions

The container executes in the context of the `algorand` user with it's own UID and GID which is handled differently depending on your operating system. Here are a few options for how to work with this environment:

#### Named Volume

Using a named volume will work without any specific configuration in most cases:

```bash
docker volume create algod-data
docker run -it --rm -d -v algod-data:/algod/data algorand/algod
```

#### Local Directory without SELinux

Explicitly set the UID and GID of the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -d -v /srv/data:/algod/data -u $UID:$GID algorand/algod
```

#### Local Directory with SELinux

Set the UID and GID of the container while add the `Z` option to the volume definition:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -d -v /srv/data:/algod/data:Z -u $UID:$GID algorand/algod
```

> See the documentation on [configuring the selinux label](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-the-selinux-label).

### Private Network

Private networks work a little bit differently. They are configured with, potentially, several data directories. The default topology supplied with this container is installed to `/algod/`, and has a single node named `data`. This means the private network has a data directory at `/algod/data`, matching the production configuration.

Because the root directory contains some metadata, if persistence of the private network is required, you should mount the volume `/algod/` instead of `/algod/data`. This will ensure the extra metadata is included when changing images.

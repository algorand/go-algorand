//     a threshold event or an empty event (forwarded to the sender)
//   - nextThresholds: It updates its next threshold cache if this
//     is a new next vote bundle for this period. Emits empty event. (We split this out
//     so that we can unit test the voteTrackerPeriod trace without depending on the
//     voteTrackerStep.)
//   - nextThresholdStatusRequest, which enables a nextThresholdStatusEvent reply
//
// In a given period, a threshold for the bottom value may or may not be seen.
// In addition, a threshold for some non-bottom proposal-value may or may not be
// seen.  (If thresholds for both a non-bottom proposal-value and bottom value are
// ever seen, any threshold for any non-bottom proposal-value has a step greater than
// any threshold for any bottom value.)

// One question you might have is why we cache both the next threshold in the period
// machine and the freshest bundle in the round machine, when they seem to expose
// redundant functionality. However, the functionality is not actually redundant.
// In particular, when soft-voting, player needs to know if it saw a next-vote
// value bundle (regardless of if it saw a next-vote bottom bundle). This is because
// of a protocol optimization to prevent "reproposers" from setting the seed Q_r.

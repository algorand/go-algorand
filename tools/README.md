# Misfit Tools

Various tools and utilities that don't have a better place to go.

## debug

Tools for debugging algod. These were really useful before launch when we spent a lot of time analyzing node behavior, but aren't needed as much recently.

## misc

Small tools that are useful in niche situations.

## network

This is a go package used by some of the CLI commands.

## TEAL

Some of the earliest tools we built for working with TEAL programs. A lot of these are workarounds for things that no longer need to be worked around, but these are still nice examples of what TEAL can do.

## x-repo-types

A tool for checking that `go-algorand` types get serialized in the same way as
purportedly clone types in other Algorand repositories.

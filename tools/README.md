# Misfit Tools

Various tools and utilities that don't have a better place to go.

### debug

Tools for debugging algod. These were really useful before launch when we spent a lot of time analyzing node behavior, but aren't needed as much recently.

### misc

Small tools that are useful in niche situations.

### network

This is a go package used by some of the CLI commands.

### TEAL

Some of the earliest tools we built for working with TEAL programs. A lot of these are workarounds for things that no longer need to be worked around, but these are still nice examples of what TEAL can do.
